Abstract—This paper develops the conceptual framework under which the project "Approach to the application of Data Science and ML as key tools for the construction of public policies in Colombia" is based, whose main objective establishes the study and analysis of various socio-economic variables that influence and determine the generation of state policies.  Throughout this article we will develop the state of the art, the problem statement, the background, the justification of the project, as well as the theoretical and methodological framework of the project, giving way to the implementation of the analysis corresponding to the selected data set; which is constituted by data obtained from the following sources: socio-economic information on Colombia updated to 2021 by the World Bank, DANE (Colombian National Department of Statistics), Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL), Kaggle Portal as well as by the Colombian government's open data portal.  This analysis will be implemented through data science and Machine learning tools to generate conclusions and proposals that can become a base instrument for the generation of policies that have a real and deep impact on vulnerable populations in Colombia.
1. INTRODUCTION
The high level of inequality in Colombia is a fundamental constraint to economic growth and social progress. The country has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world; the second highest among 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and the highest among all OECD countries. Adult income disparities arise from gaps that open up early in life for high-quality opportunities in child development, education, and health care services. Inequality in access to quality jobs further amplifies these gaps, making Colombia one of the countries where inequalities are most persistent between generations. Long-standing inequality between regions overlaps with significant gaps in well-being between Afro-descendants and indigenous Colombians and the rest of the population. The COVID-19 pandemic has further amplified existing disparities and threatens to have prolonged adverse effects; but this is only one of many potential extreme shocks, including climate change-related shocks, that could substantially widen inequality gaps. At best current tax and transfer policies, at best, have only a modest positive impact on these imbalances, so there is ample potential to improve the redistributive role of fiscal policy in Colombia. Policy reforms in many areas could help chart a more equitable future for the country (World Bank Group, 2021).

2. PROBLEM STATMENT
How can data science and ML tools become a fundamental instruments for the generation of socio-economic policies in Colombia?


3. BACKGROUND
The incorporation of new technologies for the management and analysis of large volumes of data from the IoT, drones, and satellite data applied to agriculture, gave rise to Smart Farming (Smart or precision agriculture), which allows, for example, water savings by establishing irrigation times more in line with the progress of planting, which translates into higher profits and lower production costs (Deutsch, 2018). In Latin America and the Caribbean, a 2017 study identified 130 innovation ventures using technologies such as Big Data, IoT, ML, and biotechnology, focused on the agriculture sector. Among them, more than 60% were created in the last five years, mostly in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia (Fontagro, 2018). 
On the other hand, it is expected that this proliferation of massive data will serve as food for new scientific and innovation developments that, supported by technologies such as Big Data and Blockchain, will contribute to a more efficient and sustainable development (CERAI - Center for Rural and International Agriculture Studies, 2019), and will influence the entire supply chain by driving predictive processes and the redesign of business activities among the different actors involved (Wolfert et al., 2017). 
The following is a compilation of the most relevant implementations in Colombia.

A. Agricultural sector
About this aspect, in Colombia, Hernández (2016) developed a model for the management and analysis of environmental data with the use of Big Data and AI that will support decision-making by enabling the processing and storage of meteorological and hydro-meteorological data generated by environmental monitoring stations, to then apply Deep Learning in predicting the behavior of variables such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, and pressure. Examples of Smart Farming and data analytics include the CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, managed by CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture) in Colombia (Lazo Cardona,2019).
In Colombia, the Farm app technology platform is helping the agricultural sector. Farm app implements Big Data, IoT and geolocation tools, and satellite technology, to monitor crops for pests, make forecasts because of the impact of climate change, and analyze the efficiency of pesticides and soil conditions to make a more appropriate planting (Asociación Nacional de Industriales, 2017). 

B. Education sector
In the education sector, some informatics platforms are collecting large-scale data on teaching-learning activities, of which there were no precedents, applying Data Mining and AI techniques to improve educational quality through data analysis (Raffaghelli, 2020). This has given rise to a new discipline called Learning Analytics (LA), whose fundamental objectives are the reflection and prediction of massive data (structured and unstructured), through social processing with analytical tools such as ML or classical statistical analysis (Rojas-Castro, 2017). 
Several are the researches that apply LA and Big Data as tools to strengthen teaching-learning processes. For example, at the National University of Colombia, Manizales branch, a master's degree work proposes the development of a pattern discovery model through data mining and LA, which was fed with educational data and student interactions with virtual learning platforms, to improve the teaching-learning process making it adaptive to the particularities of each student (Giraldo-Ocampo, 2017). 
On the other hand, the analysis of student data could also serve to combat academic dropout and increase quality standards in teaching. This is the case in Colombia, where a research project at the Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas proposes a model for analyzing massive data resulting from academic processes and relates them to historical and personal data to combat academic dropout (Rodríguez et al., 2019).

C. Tourism sector
In the tourism sector, data analysis tools such as Big Data, together with the implementation of data analytics algorithms and AI, are marking a new path in the promotion and dissemination of tourism centers in Latin America.  In the Colombian context, a study used data science applied to geographic information systems to analyze and visualize different variables relevant to ecotourism, to identify deficiencies and opportunities and improve decision-making in the tourism sector (Barrera et al., 2020). Likewise, the Tourism Sector Plan 2018-2022 of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism established that for the tourism sector, it is a priority to be at the forefront of new technologies that identify preferences and consumer behavior patterns, to improve marketing strategies and decision making through data analysis, Big Data, AI and ML (Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, 2018).

D. Public management
Concerning public management New data storage and analysis technologies are changing the governance of countries; despite the great benefits they offer by providing more efficient mechanisms to provide services to their citizens, they are still not government plan strategies for many developing countries. Regarding this area in Colombia, some efforts are presented as is the case of the Comptroller's Office of Bogota, which used Big Data to conduct an audit process in which it found fiscal findings for approximately US$72,000 (OLACEFS, 2018). On the other hand, the MinTIC has promoted the use of Big Data with the National Planning Department to execute an update of national GDP variations; it has also detected fraud in the policies of the System of Identification and Classification of Potential Beneficiaries for social programs (SISBEN) by tracking 653,000 cases of inconsistencies in the system in 2015 (Gomis-Balestreri, 2017).
The adoption of open data strategies has been being promoted in the region thanks to the creation of the Pacific Alliance (PA), made up of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, where one of the principles of the fourth pillar "Digital Government" is the adoption of Open Data as a tool to promote evidence-based public policies, encourage citizen participation, bring state institutions closer together and stimulate economic growth (Coordination of National Digital Strategy, Government of Mexico, 2017).

E. Industry and economy sector
In the area of Industry and Economy, Big Data and data analytics are tools that help organizations in the decision-making process by improving segmentation, communication, and customer loyalty, which is vital as a competitive advantage in an increasingly globalized market. The digitization of the industrial sector is stimulating the data center market in Latin America. This is expected to grow by 6% for the period 2019-2025, for factors such as the development of green data centers, smart agriculture, and e-Commerce to be the highest usage of Big Data analytics and IoT applications (Lazo Cardona,2019). 
According to a recent study, the Latin American Big Data and Analytics (BDA) market reached revenues of US$2,992.5 million in 2017. It is expected to generate US$8,593.5 million by 2023. Currently, Brazil leads the ranking with 46.7% of total sales, followed by Mexico (26.7%), Colombia (7.9%), Chile (6.9%), Argentina (5.6%), and Peru (2.4%) (Frost and Sullivan, 2018).
In this context, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) is leading the project "Big Data: Big Data for the Digital Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean", which aims to improve capacities for measuring the digital economy and designing evidence-based policies through big data analytics. In addition, it seeks to analyze the Internet digital economy in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, based on the processing of web and official data with Big Data (ECLAC, 2017). 
On the other hand, with the help of Big Data, in Colombia, it is possible to perform consumption analysis (Voice-Data) generated by calling on your cell phone or mobile internet consumption to generate marketing strategies in real-time, according to customer preferences (Soche, 2016).
Another national example shows how the Colombian Ministry of Finance and the DNP developed a methodology, based on Google Trends data, to statistically analyze search terms to predict and obtain economic trends in certain sectors faster than through traditional statistics (Karisma, 2016).

F. Health sector
One of the sectors that most benefits from implementing data collection and analysis techniques are health, because those tools contribute to the reduction of medical research costs, and serve to find predispositions and symptomatic patterns in various diseases. This results in better diagnosis and treatment and boosts research into new drugs. This is what happened with the company Berg, which used AI to discover the drug BPM 31510 to fight cancer (Guillén, 2017).
Thus, Big Data can help to discover the danger of a pandemic by identifying real time trends in Internet search engines such as Google Trends or data systems (Monleón-Getino, 2015). A clear example of this methodology occurred in Colombia, where research developed between the ISI Foundation and the United Nations describes that it can associate the contagion of Zika between 2014 and 2016 through the tracking of the geographical position of people when using their cell phone (Perrotta, 2018).
In Colombia, the department of Cundinamarca implemented the Unified Electronic Health Record (HCEU), a technological transformation project, which seeks to optimize and integrate the different information resources of the health services in the department by unifying the clinical history in the 35 Hospitals of the Departmental Public Network, facilitating evidence-based medical decision making (Gobernación de Cundinamarca, 2018).

G. Challenges in the implementation of technological tools
According to the above, it is possible to infer that Colombia presents an awakening toward the application of technological tools such as data science, ML, and AI as fundamental instruments in the exploration, treatment, and analysis of data. However, it can be seen that the greatest contributions come from projects generated by the educational sector, specifically by universities at the graduate level and by the impulse generated by international organizations such as the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Pacific Alliance (PA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), of which Colombia is an active member through the application of the open data strategy.
There are also some projects coming from the public sector, without establishing general guidelines for the adoption of these tools, added to the delay that the country presents concerning the digitization of documents which is at a very low level n "Artificial Intelligence will make people more efficient. It is necessary to use structured data, but only 10% of this data has this condition. Companies need to be transformed, they need to be digitized. This starts by facilitating infrastructure and seeking more productive models through technology," said Felipe Villa, corporate director of Digital Transformation at Claro Colombia.
A clear example of this problem was evidenced by the paralyzation of judicial services in Colombia during the health situation caused by the pandemic. This was demonstrated in the tutela ruling with which a court in Pasto suspended a virtual public hearing on the return of glyphosate, scheduled for May 27, because it was for communities that do not have internet access and, therefore, could not participate in it. 
As Hernando Herrera, director of the Corporación Excelencia en la Justicia (Excellence in Justice Corporation), says, the country is still in the prehistory of digital justice, which prevents it from having more agility, transparency, and interoperability. 
Colombia also has a large backlog of infrastructure and internet connectivity. Only 56.5% of households in the country have internet access, although the figure is low for Colombia as whole, rural areas are the worst off as only 23.8% of households in these territories have internet access. However, when reviewing the figures by strata, the gap is evident. While 21% of households in stratum one have internet access, 99.8% of households in stratum six are connected (DANE, 2021). Even at least 2.5 million Colombians do not have electricity in their homes. The Colombian Association of Electric Power Generators (Acolgen) has indicated that some 470,000 homes do not have access to electricity services in Colombia. With an average of four people per household, it is estimated that at least 2.5 million Colombians live without electricity.  
In addition, the Survey of Information and Communication Technologies in Homes (ENTIC Hogares, 2021) of the Dane revealed that only 39.3% of households in Colombia have a computer, the analysis found that the main reason why households did not have a computer in 2020 is that it is too expensive, both nationally and in dispersed rural and populated centers with proportions above 58.0%. Thus, in the year in which the Coronavirus pandemic demanded digitalization, 60.7% of Colombian households did not have a computer and 24.6% did not have a cell phone (Portafolio, 2021).
Currently, in the market, there is a low number of personnel trained in digital skills, which is an unprecedented problem. A study by EAFIT-Infosys shows that in 2018 the country had a deficit of 35,504 Information Technology (IT) professionals in a scenario of low growth in demand, but this deficit could reach 94,000 professionals in a scenario of high growth, in the figure some branches such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science stand out. According to the high demand for professionals specialized in digital skills that the country has and the deficit of human capital in these areas, especially in data analysis, it is necessary to train more people in data science and artificial intelligence, to provide trained personnel to companies (Ministry of Telecommunications, 2020).
With the above mentioned, Colombia faces great challenges in the adoption of the technological tools mentioned above, especially in the areas of public management. No evidence of previous works with the general objective covered by this project was found, therefore this work is the first approach to the analysis of these datasets through concepts related to data science and ML.

4. JUSTIFICATION
The presence of the State and its administrative control of the national territory has been conditioned during the last fifty years in Colombia by the control that rebel and paramilitary groups have exercised in various parts of the country, especially in the most remote regions, with the consequent weakening of local administrative capacity in those areas. Hence, one of the main pending tasks of governance aimed at implementing the national development strategy is strengthening the administrative capacity of subnational governments to formulate and implement public policies and services that reflect national standards and quality, especially in rural and remote areas, in full coordination with the national government (OECD, 2022)
On May 30, 2018, the Republic of Colombia signed an agreement to join the OECD. It will join the Organization as a member country at the time it deposits its instrument of accession to the OECD Convention. As part of its accession process, the country has taken important steps to reduce poverty and improve the delivery of public services to its citizens. The completion of this work has led Colombia to commit to continued post-accession reforms in the areas of public governance identified as priorities by the delegates of the OECD Public Governance Committee. Among its post-accession commitments, Colombia has agreed to pursue reforms in four key areas of public governance: 1. Effectiveness and efficiency of justice institutions. 2. Transparency and accountability. 3. Anti-corruption and integrity frameworks and institutions. Subnational administrative capacity. While the fourth area focuses on improving subnational administrative capacity, the other three relate to both the national and subnational levels (OECD, 2022). 
The project funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) entitled: "Fostering institutional efficiency and public governance effectiveness in Colombia as strategic factors to support inclusive growth and bring Colombia closer to the OECD" in its final report identified the following facts as the main difficulties faced by the Colombian state to generate efficient public policies that positively impact the vulnerable population:
•	The departments have several planning instruments that are rarely interrelated and with different execution deadlines, which limits their capacity to coordinate them and to monitor and evaluate the results and consequences on public policy. 
•	They lack sufficient financial and human resources to lead horizontal coordination between different secretariats or units. This fact constitutes a barrier to coordinating and implementing public policies and evaluating their results in an effective manner.
•	There is still limited stakeholder participation throughout the policy cycle, especially in the monitoring and evaluation of the Departmental Development Plans. While interviews conducted have shown that consultation is a common practice in the early stages of plans, active involvement of citizens, NGOs, and representatives of the private sector and the media remains rare in the evaluation phase. 
•	Few departments include open government principles and initiatives related to transparency, accountability, integrity, and participation in Departmental Development Plans.
Good public governance and sound administrative capacity are essential for the successful implementation of public policies in any area. Good public governance is a sine qua non of pluralistic democracies for the rule of law and respect for human rights. Effective democratic institutions are at their core and an indispensable means for open, equitable, and inclusive decision-making in the public interest and in concert with citizens to enhance the well-being and prosperity of all. In its Policy Framework for Good Public Governance (OECD, forthcoming), the OECD defines this concept as "the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of rules, processes and formal and informal interactions between the institutions and actors that make up the State, and between the State and citizens, either individually, in the form of civil society organizations, businesses, and other non-state actors, that frame the exercise of public authority in the public interest and decision-making that allows for adequate anticipation and detection of problems and, in response, underpins increases in overall prosperity and well-being" (OECD, 2022).
For the project (SIDA) Good public governance is therefore the combination of three interconnected elements:
•	Values: key behavioral traits that guide public governance in all its dimensions in a way that promotes and protects the public interest. 
•	Enabling factors: an integrated web of practices to correctly identify problems and challenges, and to formulate, implement and evaluate reforms to improve performance. 
•	Instruments and tools: a set of policy instruments and management tools for effective public policy formulation.
According to the Policy Framework, the coordination of all administrative units is one of the main factors contributing to sound public governance. The open government principles of transparency, accountability, integrity, and participation are part of the values of such governance (OECD, 2022). 
It is precisely within the framework described above, specifically in the third item "Instruments and tools" where the developments of new technologies such as data science and ML become fundamental instruments within the management tools that allow reorienting the course of the enabling factors by effectively and truthfully detecting the problems, difficulties, populations, and solutions conducive to the equitable development of the Colombian state.
Planning in the public sector is the mechanism through which public policies are developed and implemented in a way that takes into account the needs of civil society and the effective and efficient use of available resources (Friedman, 1987). For the OECD, strategic planning refers to the process of developing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating a strategic vision for a given department in Colombia. The planning process requires a high degree of coordination and leadership among all administrative nuclei, with other levels of government, and with a broad set of external actors to give a specific form to the vision, ensure its coherence, make it operational, and evaluate its performance against the strategic results it is supposed to achieve.
In 2019 Colombia developed its Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence Policy, through CONPES 3975 of 2019. In this document, it was recognized that one of the main phenomena that the country had to face, in terms of artificial intelligence (hereinafter AI), was the information asymmetries between different actors both within the country and internationally. These asymmetries were experienced at different levels. There were marked differences between the private sector's knowledge of this technology and the public sector's knowledge of it. And, beyond the asymmetries, the lack of knowledge that exists about AI in the public sector can lead to its underutilization and the generation of expectations that are not realized or do not correspond to reality. Likewise, it became evident that the academic sector of the country faced important challenges to access the tools and information on the subject, which are available in the great centers of world knowledge (Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications of Colombia, 2022).
In 2021, the Colombian government proposed the realization of the first Expert Mission focused on Artificial Intelligence. Thus, on October 21, 2021, the launching of the Mission of Experts in Artificial Intelligence took place, which became necessary as a mechanism to establish a prospective roadmap to achieve the implementation of this set of technologies from the technical and comprehensive vision of experts as a complement and guide in the path that Colombia has been tracing. This mission was completed in July 2022. Since October 21, 2021, the mission worked on the development of 3 projects which are implemented in the first phase: i. AI empowerment platform, ii. Public policy lab focused on the future of work and gender and iii. Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Ecological Development - A Roadmap for Colombia (Presidential Advisory Office for Digital Transformation and Management and Compliance, Presidency of the Republic of Colombia, 2022).
In the document "Recommendations for the development and strengthening of AI in Colombia" generated by the Mission of Wise Men, they refer to the innovation processes in the public sector: "they have not been able to test different models and experiment to scale many of these initiatives. Sometimes they wait to see what works in other countries and then implement these initiatives in the country.  This type of knowledge transfer tends to be costly and sometimes does not bear the desired fruits, as it does not obey the specific context of each country. This leads to long delays and countries being left behind in phenomena as transformative as AI. In addition, there is a need to improve access to data, evidence, and information. The information classification systems in Colombia around technology and existing measurements are few. This is something that still needs to be further explored if the country is to take full advantage of these experiences. It is expected that the country will deepen its measures of evaluation and monitoring of technology policies in the coming years, which is only possible if it begins to make significant efforts in the collection and access to information on the progress of emerging technologies in all sectors".
Likewise, the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications of Colombia in its report "Analytics tools for data exploitation 2018" determined that: "The data stored by state entities are generated quickly and are complex, however, within them is contained a large amount of extremely useful information for decision making; that is why it highlights the importance of analyzing and interpreting these data and convert them into information that state entities can use in their favor to improve their performance and be more efficient. Data analysis refers to the review of data to draw conclusions from the information. This activity allows for improving the decision-making of companies, entities, and institutions in general. Data analysis is essential for the fulfillment of the objectives of all government agencies since it allows for obtaining more effective results more efficiently. The growing volume of data and its increasingly diverse nature allow having more enriching information for decision-making, however, they can also paralyze the organization, since a large amount of information has caused the traditional means of storage and processing to be insufficient, and this is where Big Data processing comes in, as it allows the storage and examination of large volumes of data at high speed, to extract patterns and unknown and useful relationships for understanding the operation and improvement of the institution; These improvements translate into the streamlining of decision making for the generation of social and economic value, whether products, services or processes". 
For all the above mentioned, the implementation of this work is widely justified and constitutes a basic tool for the analysis of variables conducive to the generation of public policies of the Colombian state.

5.THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

Colombia is one of the most unequal countries in the world. 
 
Income inequality in Colombia is the highest among all OECD countries and the second highest among 18 LAC countries.1 The Gini coefficient of household income (a standard measure of inequality) reached 0.53 in 2019, after paying taxes and receiving transfers. For comparison, the Gini coefficient of the most equal OECD country, the Slovak Republic, was 0.24. The income of the richest 10% of the Colombian population is eleven times higher than that of the poorest 10%. Again, by way of comparison, in the Slovak Republic, the richest 10% of the population earns three times more than the poorest 10%. The economic impact of COVID-19 has further increased inequality, pushing the Gini coefficient up to 0.54 in 2020 and dragging about 3.6 million more people into poverty. There are also significant inequalities between different population groups. A woman in Colombia is 1.7 times more likely to be unemployed than a man. An indigenous Colombian receives on average two fewer years of schooling than other Colombians, and an Afro-Colombian is twice as likely to live in a poor neighborhood. Two-thirds of the children of migrants from Venezuela are not enrolled in school, compared to less than one-tenth of non-migrants. Surprisingly, inequality in Colombia extends beyond material aspects of livelihoods (World Bank Group, 2021).

 
Fig.1. Gini coefficient in Colombia in relation to other countries, and gaps in poverty rates. 

Colombians with less education, the rural population, and the unemployed or poor are much less likely to consider themselves happy. Inequalities also persist between generations. Children in Colombia face very different life prospects because of the circumstances into which they are born: a child of a low-income parent is likely to earn less than a child of a high-income parent. Among a group of 75 countries, the transfer of the income gap from one generation to the next in Colombia is the most entrenched (Narayan et al. 2018).
 
Children from poor families could take an average 330 years to move out of poverty, or eleven generations to reach the median income of their country (OECD, 2018). The study "A broken down social elevator? How to promote social mobility", which spanned four years and included more than 20 countries in different parts of the world, points out that social mobility stagnated and inequality increased in the last decade.  

Based on this study, Colombia is the most unequal country in Latin America due to its high concentration of income. And this is not the usual measurement using the Gini Coefficient. In the OECD study, the researchers analyzed the household income of the 40% of the population with the least economic resources and the richest 10%. It was there that they observed the gaps in income distribution, but they were particularly struck by the regional differences in the country and the low quality of access to good quality jobs (Gabriela Ramos, Director General of the OECD,2019).
 
A large part of the population moves into the world of informal employment, with no real possibilities for progression. "They have no medical coverage, no pensions, no basic services. So the difficulties are reproduced because the redistributive impact of the tax and social security system does not reach the poorest", Likewise in several countries of the region there are families that manage to get out of poverty, but quickly fall back into it because of any fortuitous event, something that some analysts often call "a vulnerable middle class" that returns to its original situation at any unforeseen event. For example, it is enough for a member of the family to fall ill for the circle to repeat itself. Just as wealth is inherited, poverty is also inherited (Gabriela Ramos, Director General of the OECD, 2019).
 
Several governments in Colombia have implemented cash transfers to reduce poverty, but such policies do not change the underlying problem: inequality. And in the case of Colombia, the situation is more acute. In addition, the country has poor results in international tests that measure the quality of education, an essential factor for social mobility. "In Colombia, there are barely 11% of resilient students, which are those who obtain higher grades than their socioeconomic status would predict" (Gabriela Ramos, Director General of the OECD,2019).
 
This high inequality is rooted in large regional disparities, as there is a large gap between urban and rural areas. Colombia has one of the highest levels of regional inequality in GDP per capita among OECD countries (OECD, 2014). Inequalities particularly affect ethnic minorities and people displaced by conflict, who are disproportionately concentrated in rural areas. Inequality is also a gender issue, as female employment is low and wage differentials have been increasing. 

The increasing flow of immigration from Venezuela mainly affects the northwestern regions of the country, adding to regional disparities. Access to high-quality education and health is also unequal across regions and socioeconomic groups The pension system exacerbates inequalities, leaving many older people in poverty, given the low coverage among the most vulnerable population (OECD, 2019).


 
Fig2.Differences in Poverty Headcount by Group,%, 2019:

Inequalities begin in early life, with gaps in education and health care. 
The report "Towards building an equitable society in Colombia" implemented by the World Bank in 2022 determined that in Colombia, inequalities affect people from the beginning of their lives in a way that has consequences on the accumulation of human capital and, therefore, on the opportunities available when entering the labor market or earning an income. First, learning opportunities are not the same for all children in Colombia. 
Afro-Colombian and indigenous populations lose the equivalent of 4.7 and 4.5 years of education, respectively, when adjusting years of schooling with actual learning outcomes, figures that exceed what other groups lose by a full year or more. 
The gaps between schooling and learning are largely related to differences in teacher quality and the way teachers are assigned to schools.
The study also found that despite a substantial expansion in health insurance in recent years, there are large differences in access to high-quality medical care. This contributes to disparities in outcomes: poorer children have stunting rates that are three times higher than those of wealthier children. Two factors affect the quality of health care delivery: 

•	Current formulas for financing health care providers do not take into account the risk profile of the typical patient, providing little incentive to extend differentiated care to patients with different risk factors.
•	Information on the quality of service delivery is limited and insufficiently used to better plan and deliver services at the local level. 


Promoting human capital accumulation from early childhood requires simplifying administrative procedures for citizens to access early childhood development (ECD) services, introducing a core curriculum for basic skills throughout the education system, and providing pedagogical support to teachers on the core curriculum guidelines. 
At the same time, it also requires strengthening the linkages between basic and tertiary education and ensuring the quality and relevance of the curriculum. In health, the service delivery model must be transformed into a primary healthcare system that is adapted to local needs, and accreditation and financial incentives must be provided to health insurers. In gender, for example, there is a pending agenda to address the barriers in labor regulations that affect women as well as the few policies generated to increase access to and quality of childcare, so that more women can participate in the labor market (World Bank Group, 2021).

 
Fig3 Inequalities begin in early life; in education, actual learning outcomes differ greatly between ethnic groups. learning gaps between ethnic groups.

Disparities in access to good jobs widen inequalities in human capital. 
Only 40% of working Colombians are employed in the formal sector, one of the lowest rates in LAC. There are no policies aimed at creating jobs in the formal sector, leaving the majority of Colombians working in the informal sector. 
The jobs of the future may also be out of reach for many, due to the slow adoption of new technologies among disadvantaged groups, a barrier that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated. 
Indeed, with a ranking of 109 out of 141 countries, Colombia has one of the world's largest disparities in technology use among socioeconomic groups: while 73% of people in the top 60% use the Internet, that figure is only 53% among those in the bottom 40% (World Bank, 2021).

 
Fig4. The Quality of Jobs in Terms of Formality and Earnings in LAC.

Territorial inequalities are also high, leaving many people disconnected from key services and opportunities. 
The gap between the richest and poorest regions in Colombia is more than double that of other OECD countries5. Spatial disparities overlap with population groups defined by ethnicity: municipalities with high concentrations of indigenous Colombians have persistently high levels of unmet basic needs, and Afro-Colombians live predominantly in urban areas where, between 2005 and 2018, unmet basic needs remained above other cities. Inadequate housing and infrastructure are the main sources of inequality in cities.
 Of the 5.1 million households with housing vulnerability in Colombia6, almost 4.4 million are in urban areas. Inequality has worsened in the territories most affected by the armed conflict, which has intensified disparities in access to productive factors, particularly rural land. 
Colombia is among the top five most unequal countries in the world, in terms of land concentration (Cuesta and Pico, 2020b): 81% of private land is concentrated in the top 1% of farms, the highest among the 15 countries in the region, and significantly higher than the regional average of 52% (Guereña, 2017).

 Fig5. Unsatisfied basic needs in 2005 and 2018.

Reducing territorial inequality requires policies that strengthen the technical capacity and fiscal performance of subnational governments, particularly among those that lag and need more support. Expanding connectivity, from residential sections of peri-urban areas and smaller municipalities to the tertiary and secondary road network, and strengthening housing programs can also increase access to opportunities and reduce inequalities. 
Policies should better target those population groups that have historically been segregated (e.g., Afro-descendants, indigenous communities, and, recently, migrants) (World Bank, 2021).


Taxes and transfers do little to address glaring inequalities. 
Compared to other OECD and LAC countries, taxes and transfers in Colombia do little to reduce income inequality. Because deductions and tax thresholds in the personal income tax (IRP) are very high, people start paying it only if their income is very high, about four times the median income. This deprives the state of resources that could be redistributed to the poorest (World Bank, 2021).
.

In addition, value-added tax (VAT) exemptions and zero-rating, which are intended to make VAT less regressive, end up giving large tax breaks to high-income earners: more than half (57%) of VAT tax expenditures benefit the top three deciles of the income distribution. In addition, cash transfer programs and subsidies for gas, water, and electricity suffer large leakages to high-income households. It is estimated that, according to their socioeconomic profile, more than 65% of households receiving subsidies should receive a lower subsidy or no subsidy at all. Finally, the public pension system generates implicit (and quite generous) subsidies that accrue mainly to high pension beneficiaries (World Bank, 2021).
the families in action initiative help the poor but a large part of the program reaches the non-poor as evidenced in the following graph.

 Fig7. Relevance and destination of Familias en Acción transfers by income decile.

Internal and external shocks hinder progress toward equality. 
The COVID-19 shock increased poverty by 6.8 percentage points in 2020, and 3.6 million more people became poor, particularly in urban areas. It also caused extreme poverty to increase by 5.5 percentage points, leaving 2.8 million more people unable to meet basic food needs. 
The pandemic has also exacerbated inequalities in human capital: the learning poverty rate7 among 10-year-olds is expected to increase from 53% to 60% if schools maintain a hybrid learning program through 2021, or from 63% if distance learning continues year-round. However, COVID-19 is just one of the extreme shocks that can worsen inequalities (World Bank, 2021). 
Climate shocks can, too. Estimates indicate that households in the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution would suffer income losses from climate change shocks that, on average, are 1.5 to 1.6 times higher (as a percentage of pre-shock income) than those suffered by the top quintile. 
Rural households are expected to suffer income losses that, on average, are 1.8 to 1.9 times higher than those of urban households. However, social assistance programs are not designed to flexibly protect households against shocks, especially weather-related shocks, and the resulting depletion of assets. The lack of a social registry with dynamic and accurate household information, and equipped with climate risk assessment tools, limits the ability of these programs to adapt to new circumstances (World Bank, 2021).

Economic and Social Inequality
Income inequality in Colombia is very high. In 2019, it was the highest among all OECD countries, and most Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Moreover, inequality in Colombia has been on the rise since 2018 and was further exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. 
At the rate of decline observed between 2008 and 2019, just before the pandemic broke out, it would take Colombia at least three and a half decades to reach the average level of inequality of OECD countries.1 Beyond income inequality, Colombia scores poorly on many other dimensions of inequality (World Bank, 2022). 
 Fig8. GINI Coefficient for Colombia (2008-2020).

The following graphs show the current welfare ratio between Colombia, the OECD and the average of Chile and Mexico, two major references for Latin America.

 
Fig9. Welfare indicators

Figure 9 considers different indicators of well-being. For each indicator, the Figure shows where Colombia ranks, in terms of inequality, relative to the best-performing countries in the OECD and LAC (distance to the frontier). In this international comparison, Colombia ranks at the bottom of many indicators (World Bank, 2022).

 
Fig10. Colombia's distance to the frontier, from LAC and OECD countries, across inequality dimensions.

Inequalities are particularly acute among specific population groups, to the detriment of women, people living in rural areas, indigenous groups, Afro-descendants, and migrants (World Bank, 2021). 
Poverty rates are significantly higher in rural, migrant, indigenous, and Afro-descendant households (Figure 1.3).2 A Colombian born in Chocó is five times more likely to be born into poverty than one born in Bogotá. Similarly, a woman in Colombia is 1.7 times more likely to be unemployed than a man (World Bank, 2021). 
An indigenous Colombian has on average two fewer years of schooling than a non-indigenous one. Two-thirds of the children of Venezuelan migrants (almost 250,000 children, ages 5 to 18) are not enrolled in school, in contrast to other children, who account for 8%. Afro-Colombians are twice as likely to live in slums compared to non-Afro-descendants. When group characteristics overlap, opportunity exclusions are mutually reinforcing. For example, the income gap between the average Colombian woman and man is larger if the woman is indigenous or if she lives in a rural area if other factors do not intervene (World Bank, 2021).

 
Fig11. Differences in poverty incidence, by group; percentage points (2019) group.
Inequalities also persist over generations, and Colombia has one of the highest rates of persistence of inequality from one generation to the next. Colombia has one of the highest rates of persistence of inequality from one generation to the next. Parents' level of education has a strong positive influence on children's educational attainment.3 This is common in many countries. However, among 146 countries included in the World Bank's Global Database on Intergenerational Mobility (GDIM), Colombia ranks 122nd in the persistence of education across generations and ranks equally low in educational (World Bank, 2021).

 
Fig12. Percentage of children born into families with parents in the first two quartiles of educational attainment who reach the highest quartile who achieve in the highest quartile (relative mobility)
This is so, despite advances in educational attainment, even though the proportion of children with a better education than their parents has increased. below is the absolute mobility graph that evidences the percentage of children with a higher educational level than their parents.

 
Fig13. Percentage of children with a higher level of education higher than that of their parents (absolute mobility).

In Colombia, if a person is born to parents in the bottom half of the educational attainment scale, his or her probability of reaching the top 25% of educational attainment is only close to 10% (this is around 15% in medium-developed countries) (Narayan et al. 2018). Even more salient is the persistence of income from one generation to the next. Among the 75 countries for which data on intergenerational income persistence are available, Colombia ranks first (World Bank, 2021).
Note: 75 countries are included in the analysis. Intergenerational income mobility should be read as follows: if a Colombian earns twice as much as another man earns, the first man's son can be expected to earn more than twice as much as the first man's son as an adult. the son of the first man can be expected to earn, as an adult, more than twice as much as the son of the lower-earning man (because the of the man with the lowest income (since the coefficient for Colombia is greater than 1).(World Bank, 2018).

 
Fig14. Intergenerational persistence of income.

Inequality worries Colombians. Approximately four out of five Colombians believe that income distribution is unfair or severely unfair, and this perception has increased even in periods of slight declines in the Gini coefficient. 
At the political level, the deep inequalities that exist in Colombia have not gone unnoticed, and have gained prominence in recent years. Mitigating inequality has been high on the government's agenda, as set out in the National Development Plan (2018-2022). Today, addressing inequality is even more important to the goal of reducing poverty in Colombia, where the COVID-19 crisis has erased more than a decade of progress.

Socioeconomic stratification: a public policy of solidarity and redistribution of solidarity and redistribution in the SPD tariff
Under the premise: "Colombia is a Social State of Law founded, among other constitutional principles, on solidarity and the redistribution of the income of the people who make it up", the justification for the creation of stratification in Colombia is generated.
With stratification, the Colombian state has sought to ensure that households with higher incomes economically assist the lower-income population to access, via subsidized rates, household public services (water and sewerage, sanitation, electricity, and natural gas) to achieve universal coverage. In addition to being a mechanism for the allocation of other subsidies and aid to those in the first deciles of payment capacity (differential payments in the education system, differentiation of property tax rates, and differentiation of rates for payments to the State, among others) with time, stratification has become established both in material life and in the collective imagination as an element of social and economic, cultural, and ideological differentiation of the population (Bonilla, López, Sepúlveda, 2014).
The document: “Socio-economic stratification as a targeting instrument” by (Mina,2004) carries out an in-depth analysis of the stratification process in Colombia, starting from the background and foundations for its creation, its implementation, its impact on the population, its successes and failures. Based on this article, the origin and foundations of this concept are presented.
The cadastral appraisal was the basis for the application of public utility tariffs throughout the seventies; since the early eighties, the DANE gave a series of definitions that constituted the starting point for the creation of the six (6) existing socioeconomic strata. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the companies classified the users of public services into the same number of strata but based on their criteria. 
In 1992, the National Planning Department was commissioned to design a methodology for urban and rural areas. Law 142 or the Residential Public Services Regime of 1994 created socio-economic stratification as the indicator that governs the tariff policy. Socio-economic stratification has been designed to facilitate the application of differential tariffs to different users of household public services, to help select a certain target population among those with fewer resources, and to focus on some social programs.
According to the National Human Development Program (2003), throughout the 1990s, spending on drinking water and basic sanitation represented between 0.15 and 0.41 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product. In 2001, the share of such expenditure as a proportion of GDP was 0.20 percent. This percentage, which might seem low, is comparable to that allocated to the group of services that make up social assistance and welfare. What are those provided by the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF), and all programs associated with the care of the elderly, children, the disabled, the mentally ill, and other family-related social protection services. The magnitude of spending on public utilities, therefore, merits an evaluation of how users with low capacity to pay are identified and to whom subsidies are allocated.
Together with the SISBEN and the Unsatisfied Basic Needs Index (NBI), socio-economic stratification is one of the main tools for targeting public spending, and it is therefore vital to evaluate its capacity to identify the poorest population.
The socio-economic stratification methodology
The stratification adopted in the different municipalities of the country includes variables related to the characteristics of the dwellings and their environment. A total of eight (8) variables are taken into account:
1. Existence of dwellings on the side of the block with the main entrance.
2. The type of access routes on the street or road on the block side: footpath or road, pedestrian, vehicular or pathway, pedestrian, vehicular on dirt, vehicular on gravel, vehicular on concrete, asphalt or asphalt vehicular on concrete, asphalt, or cobblestone.
3. Presence of pollution sources on the side of the block or in front of the block: sewage in view of the block. sewage in sight, rubbish dumps, slaughterhouses, market place, workshops, factories, terminals, etc. marketplace, workshops, factories, bus terminals, canteens, bars, etc.
4. Predominance of pavements on the side of the housing block without sidewalks, with sidewalks but without pavements, with pavements but without green space, or with both. The predominance of dwellings on the block side without a front garden, with either a small, medium, or large front garden.
6. Presence of dwellings without garages on the block side or with garages with different characteristics. 
7. Material of the facades on the block side: Guadua, cane, matting, board, or waste; uncovered, i.e. adobe, wattle, and daub, brick, brickwork, prefabricated slab, block, or brick; in plaster, rendering, or rendering (unpainted or painted; with veneer, in polished brick or in fine wood. or in fine wood.
8. Type of material of the main door: board, bamboo, matting, zinc or fabric; polished wood, sheet metal, wood veneer, wood veneer. polished wood, sheet metal, worked iron or aluminum frame; finely carved or completely aluminum; finely carved wood or entirely in glass.
Although the methodology has as its central axis the eight variables noted above, there are some differences between the different cities, which vary according to the number of inhabitants and blocks, the number and type of economic activities carried out in them, and the degree of Unsatisfied Basic Needs (UBN). The housing is classified in one or another of the six (6) strata adopted in most municipalities in the country.
The socio-economic strata in which the dwellings and/or properties can be classified are 6, denominated as follows:

 Table1: Socio-economic stratification in Colombia.
Source: Own elaboration

"Of these, strata 1, 2, and 3 correspond to low strata that house users with lower resources, who are beneficiaries of subsidies for residential public utilities; strata 5 and 6 correspond to high strata that house users with greater economic resources, who must pay additional costs (contribution) on the value of residential public utilities. Stratum 4 is not a beneficiary of subsidies, nor does it have to pay cost overruns; it pays exactly the value defined by the company as the cost of providing the service. The classification in any of the six strata is an approximation to the hierarchical socioeconomic difference, read poverty to wealth or vice versa" (DANE, 2023).
Thus, the tariff not only determines to a large extent the value be paid, since its components generate considerable differences between the tariffs managed by the different companies that provide the same service, but it does not depend on the users' ability to pay (socio-economic condition of those who demand them) and does not even take it into account, as occurs when estimating the price of most goods and services. The subsidy or contribution percentage (P%) consists of optional caps or maximums, theoretically constant at the national level for each socio-economic stratum, as established by law (Table 2) (CELAC, 2006).
 
Table2. Strata and Subsidy or contribution factor

The legislature, in approving the SPD regime, thus defined the extent to which socio-economic conditions can affect billing: no matter how poor a residential user is, he will only be eligible for SPD if he pays 50% of what it costs to provide it, even if the bill could be considered onerous; likewise, no matter how rich a user is and even if the tariff is very low, he will only be obliged to contribute 20% more than what it costs (CELAC, 2006). 
On the other hand, non-residential users, i.e. commercial, industrial, and institutional users, also contribute to subsidizing the lower strata. Exempt from this contribution, at the customer's request, are hospitals, clinics, health posts and centers, and non-profit educational and welfare centers. 
Article 2 of Law 632 of 2000 provided that the surcharge factor should be adjusted to the percentage necessary to ensure that the amount of contributions is sufficient to cover the subsidies applied (CELAC, 2006).
The stratum to which the aforementioned subsidy or contribution percentage corresponds, as indicated, is the one resulting from "the classification of residential properties in a municipality", maximum in six groups, implicitly considered a proxy of economic capacity, and in accordance with the levels that have distinguished the tariff system for several decades. The unit value (reference cost or tariff by subsidy or contribution percentages, by service and billing period according to the company) is, then, the one that is affected by the socio-economic stratum.
 It is not the tariff itself, as has commonly been suggested. In this way, a residential user, depending on the stratum in which his or her dwelling is classified, is billed for consumption at a certain percentage of the tariff (not the total consumption but the basic or minimum subsistence consumption,10 or subsidized consumption in the case of strata 1, 2 or 3) (CELAC, 2006).
"As a result of this classification in the same city, one can find homes as dissimilar as those ranging from the slum that expresses -without a doubt- the misery of its inhabitants, to the mansion or palace that, in the same way, evidences an enormous accumulation of wealth. The same happens in the rural area with houses ranging from shacks without walls to "ranches", haciendas with large extensions of productive land, and recreational estates with exuberant comforts" (DANE, 2023).
In addition to being a mechanism for the allocation of other subsidies and aid to those in the first deciles of ability to pay (differential payments in the education system, differentiation of property tax rates, differentiation of rates for payments to the state, among others), over time, stratification has become established both in material life and in the collective imagination as an element of social and economic, cultural and ideological differentiation of the population (CELAC, 2006).
Socio-economic stratification seeks to respond to the purpose of identifying subsidized or subsidized housing, based on two basic assumptions. On the one hand, it is possible to discriminate against users according to their income level, payment capacity, or socioeconomic characteristics. 
On the other hand, the characteristics of the environment make it possible to define homogeneous groups of users for the differential collection of SPD. The assumption of the existence of these relationships led to a stratification methodology that does not explicitly consider aspects associated with the socio-economic characteristics of households, but rather classifies them by seeking homogeneities directly on the characteristics of the properties and their surroundings (Bonilla, López, Sepúlveda, 2014)


Socio-economic stratification and household income and expenditures 
Income is not among the variables that are part of socio-economic stratification. It is based, as noted above, on the characteristics of the dwelling and the conditions of the environment in which it is located. However, for equity purposes, it is expected that there is a high correlation between the distribution of households resulting from applying the stratification method and that obtained from income. This should be the case since one of the objectives of stratification, and perhaps the most important one is to cross-subsidize, i.e. to redistribute income (Mina, 2004).
Table3 presents the distribution of households according to their share of total income resulting from stratification. In terms of income, the results do not indicate a very equitable situation. Households at all income levels are part of stratum 1: about 46% of this is made up of households in deciles 4 to 7, and only 31% of other households in the first two deciles. Meanwhile, households in stratum 2 are made up of about 50% of people from deciles 5 to 9. Although 71% of people in stratum 6 are from the top decile, there are people in the bottom five income deciles (8.2%). Given the above, payments for residential public services that adopt the stratification methodology do not seem to be in accordance with the users' ability to pay, understood as the household's income level (Mina, 2004).

 
Table3. Distribution of households by income decile and socioeconomic stratum (2003).

In other words, as of 2003, the conclusion remains the same as VÉLEZ (1996, p. 216): The process of socioeconomic stratification fails to efficiently distinguish the richest households from the middle-income and poorest households.
As a result, there is a high proportion of high-income household’s subject to tariffs and subsidies very close to those corresponding ideally to the lower strata. According to VÉLEZ (1996), in an ideal stratification, the first stratum should only include households in the first two income deciles, the second stratum is made up of households between the second and fourth income deciles, the third stratum includes households between the fourth and sixth, and the sixth stratum would include households in the top two income deciles. 
So far, a fairly low correlation has been found between stratification and income, which, measured through Pearson's coefficient, although significant at a level of 1%, only reaches a value of 0.249.
The problems of socioeconomic stratification. A gradual erosion of the instrument 
Several studies on the evaluation of stratification and its possible relationship between household economic capacity and the characteristics of households using public services highlight problematic aspects of the redistribution instrument. The discussion of how to approach the socioeconomic conditions of the inhabitants of stratified households has been the subject of different studies and proposals. Some attempt to establish the correlation between income, expenditure levels, and housing characteristics. Others correlate the economic capacity of households, measured from the quality of life indicators or poverty levels, with the characterization of the dwellings they inhabit. 
Still, others connect the characteristics of homes and environments based on multidimensional perspectives of human well-being. More recently, other approaches correlate the economic capacity of households with the quality of urban life enjoyed by users of public services derived both from their economic level and the environment and the quality of public goods offered by cities. In all cases, the approximations coincide with the fiscal policy perspective that assumes that the principles of benefit and ability to pay to refer to divergent conceptions of justice to solve the social problem of financing public goods (Bonilla, López, Sepúlveda, 2014).
Based on the document: "La estratificación socioeconómica para el cobro de los servicios públicos domiciliarios en Colombia ¿Solidaridad o focalización?" prepared by the United Nations - ECLAC, 2006. The following findings are described:
The Mission to Support Decentralization and Targeting of Social Services or Social Mission of the DNP, in 1993, contracted the study Social Expenditure in SPD of the aqueduct, sewerage, electricity, and gas, carried out by the firm Econometría S.A., under the socioeconomic stratification for the collection of domiciliary public services in Colombia Solidarity or targeting?  directed by Álvaro Reyes Posada and coordinated by Carlos Eduardo Vélez, and Ernesto May and Ariel Fiszbein on behalf of the World Bank, the results of which were succinctly published in 1995.26 
In his study, Vélez evaluates the discriminatory power of socioeconomic stratification using per capita income as an indicator of the economic status of each household. To this end, he measures the statistical correlation between the socioeconomic stratum of each household and its respective income decile, assuming that the stratification should agglutinate the greatest number of users in the ideal stratification band, which he illustrates as follows:

 Table4. Socioeconomic strata and income deciles: "ideal" stratification and type i and ii errors.
The researcher finds a "weak association" between housing quality (wealth) and the strata, which he attributes to possible technical deficiencies in the qualification system or to an interesting manipulation of it. Vélez (1995) goes on to note that the evaluation of stratification; shows that it functions precariously in the eight main Colombian cities investigated in the 1992 National Household Survey No. 77, the source of information for his study. 
The quality of the stratification, calibrated against the income deciles of this group of cities, leaves much to be desired since the Pearson correlation coefficients are less than half the feasible level under an ideal stratification. 
Thus, for 38% of the SPD user households in these cities, type II stratification error is committed, that is, more or less two out of every five households are classified in strata lower than those that would ideally correspond to them according to their income level; and almost a quarter of the user households are subject to type I error, that is, they are classified in strata higher than those that correspond to them according to their income level. 
The inefficiency of stratification, according to the study, is more marked in Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Manizales, and Pasto than in large cities (United Nations - ECLAC, 2006).
Likewise, the study by Libia Martínez (2004) wonders about the validity of the variables of the DNP stratification model to achieve an adequate classification of people in terms of their income, and states that stratification is not an indicator of the quality of life, inequality or poverty, but strictly speaking it is an indicator of income, concluding that: "The model leaves out many of the fundamental socioeconomic variables so that it can hardly be accepted as reflecting the level of income and its differences and, therefore, inequality..." 
She goes on to say that, in terms of informative relevance, it can be affirmed that the indicator is simplistic and does not respond to plural informative bases, since it does not consider variables that identify well-being in a broad sense, such as human capital, people's freedoms, people's perceptions of their living conditions, or variables such as access to SPD, levels of education or access to health services, including in other traditional indicators; and that it is conceived more from the point of view of the spatial distribution of the city's inhabitants, a necessary aspect for urban planning, but which does not consider the variables mentioned above (2004: 77-78). Incompatibility between DANE's stratified sampling frame and the "sampling frame" of the stratifications made by the municipalities with DNP's methodologies (United Nations - ECLAC, 2006). 
The sampling frame is the inventory of all the existing blocks or properties in the urban or rural area, obtained from the national or city censuses. DANE stratified the blocks of the sample frame of 53 cities, starting from updating the cartography or plans that graphically express the spatial location of the dwellings when it carried out the Population Studies between 1980 and 1983. For this purpose, it applied a methodology designed by the entity, consisting of the definition of six strata that, perceptively, the interviewer assigned to each block, without using weightings of the variables involved or a statistical method of classification into strata (See Annex 2). With this same methodology, he stratified only the new developments (blocks) occurring in 1989 and 1993 (United Nations - ECLAC, 2006). 
The stratification of the sampling frame "aims to reduce sampling error by seeking the maximum possible homogeneity within each stratum, and the greatest possible heterogeneity between strata" (DANE, 1989); also, there are several reasons for stratifying the frames: in order to have estimated by stratum, to establish the Household and Quality of Life Surveys, it does not use the sample frame of stratified blocks but the sample frame of stratified sections, which is built from estimating the modal stratum of the section (group of approximately 20 contiguous blocks). 
In compliance with the legal mandate to use the SPD stratifications to stratify the sample frames (article 13 of Law 505 of 1999), in 2001 DANE informed the DNP that it had done an exercise for the 14 main cities and that it encountered difficulties in assigning it because the blocks did not coincide, The DANE reported to the DNP in 2001 that it had done an exercise for the 14 main cities, and that it had encountered difficulties in assigning it because the blocks did not coincide, in a percentage that ranged between 11% and 26% (except Cartagena, 3%), and because of considerable differences in the proportions of strata, mainly 1 and 2, which is why it had only adopted the SPD strata in the cities of Bucaramanga, Medellín, Cali and Barranquilla (DANE, 2001) (DANE, 2001).
Analyzing the effect of the fact that the information observed (collected) in one stratum is imputed to another stratum, as DANE does, for example, in the ECH (Encuesta Continua de Hogares, formerly Encuesta Nacional de Hogares), is of the greatest statistical importance. 
It is equally important to understand that, to the extent that the strata of the DANE sample frames are not the same as the "sample frames or censuses" of the SPD stratification, it is inappropriate to equate both stratifications to examine the targeting or allocation of SPD subsidies, 35 since these subsidies have been granted to households other than those eligible for subsidies as reported by DANE, which in the past were those of the stratification of each company, and today are the result of the stratifications of the municipalities-DNP-companies (United Nations - ECLAC, 2006).
The inappropriateness of comparing the LCS strata of different years and asserting that the changes are due to discretional stratification management to explain the changes that occurred in the stratification of the country during a period, and even more delicate, to analyze the targeting of SPD subsidies, the researchers of the studies reviewed used the stratifications of the DANE LCS. 
These surveys are not statistically representative by strata; nor do they investigate the same units: cities or municipal capitals, rural population centers, and rural areas with scattered houses and farms; and they do not even allow comparison between regions, since some are different (Bogotá was with Soacha in the 1997 survey, the Pacific included the Valley, and the Atlantic included the Archipelago). 
As can be seen in the first table of the previous section, the distributions of strata vary significantly during the period, without the researchers who have used them, nor DANE itself, providing explanations for data that are taken for granted. If we do not take into account that the stratifications registered by DANE in the three surveys, as indicated above, correspond to stratifications from different sources, it can be lightly asserted, as almost all of the researchers cited above do, that the changes are due to excessive discretion in the administration of the system or manipulation of the results by the mayor's offices, even when they had no authority over the stratifications used to assign SPD subsidies, since in 1993 the stratification was the responsibility of the companies and only became the responsibility of the mayor's offices, in practice, after 1995, and even later, given the slowness with which they have adopted the studies derived from the DNP's methodologies(United Nations - ECLAC, 2006).
Other studies warn about the presentation of critical errors in the stratification process, such as the case of the book Socio-economic stratification and cadastral information. Introduction to the problem and future perspectives by researchers BONILLA, J., LÓPEZ, D., and SEPÚLVEDA RICO, C.E., LÓPEZ CAMACHO, D., and GALLEGO ACEVEDO, J.M., Editorial Universidad del Rosario: Alcaldía Mayor de Bogotá D.C., 2014. In which the problem of stratification is described when studying its relationship with household income is reinforced by taking other indicators of poverty or ability to pay as a reference. 
Martinez (2004) study for Bogotá the relationship of strata with the incidence of poverty by unsatisfied basic needs (nbi), the poverty line (lp), and households receiving less than one minimum wage per capita. 
The study also shows a correlation with household consumption structure. For all indicators, the existence of inclusion and exclusion errors is clear. Strata that receive subsidies (1, 2, and 3) have a significant percentage of non-poor. If we take, for example, stratum 2, 27% of households in this group are not poor according to the lp, and 22% according to the minimum wage criterion, and yet they receive subsidies for the payment of spd tariffs. Meanwhile, the analysis of current spending is used to prove that spending on food and public services is proportionally higher in the lower strata than in the higher strata, which suggests a regressive scheme in the collection of tariffs.
Meléndez (2004, 2008) proposes a subsidy targeting index that also captures the existence of inclusion and exclusion errors. For the case of water and sewerage in Bogota, it is concluded that by 2003, the system was providing subsidies to more than 80% of non-poor connected households. In general terms, the study states that "although stratification has made it possible to allocate subsidies to poor households, this has been achieved at the cost of huge inclusion errors that translate into wasted resources" (Bonilla, López, Sepúlveda, 2014).

In an evaluation by the National Planning Department (DNP) of stratification as an instrument for classifying users, Econometrica (2006) suggests the need to explore a much more precise definition of capacity to pay. 
Based on a Paretian conceptualization (consumer theory) proposed to refer to minimum or subsistence levels in the expenditure of goods and the problem of their optimization, a set of variables that make up a more elaborate indicator of the ability to pay is analyzed to propose a comparison between initial indicators of permanent disposable income and recurrent expenditure (which includes expenditure on food and housing) with data from the co-censal survey of the 2005 Census. From this, the correlation between the ability to pay and socioeconomic and poverty variables is established, on the one hand; and the explanation that the ability to pay can offer with respect to stratification is sought, on the other (Bonilla, López, Sepúlveda, 2014).
Based on a review of the most problematic aspects involved in stratification in the diagnoses carried out at different times, studies on the application of the instrument show that, over the years, it ceased to reflect the unequal economic capacity approximated from the different approaches (Bonilla, López, Sepúlveda, 2014). 
Consequently, exclusion and inclusion errors increased, calling into question the efficiency and effectiveness of the stratification mechanism. The basic information of the model had lost validity and had even been manipulated by political interests (authorities assigning the stratum according to electoral interests, for example), or simply had not been flexible enough to respond to changes in the urban structure (Bonilla, López, Sepúlveda, 2014).. 
At the beginning of the 21st century, it was clear to the country that the stratification of the previous ten years was inefficient due to errors of inclusion and exclusion, lack of monitoring of socio-economic dynamics, and the use of the information that fed the classification model. This was recognized in the Conpes 3386 document of 2005 (Bonilla, López, Sepúlveda, 2014).


System for the Identification of Potential Beneficiaries of Social Programs: Sisbén

Based on the web portal https://www.sdp.gov.co/gestion-estudios-estrategicos/sisben/preguntas-frecuentes corresponding to the Secretary of Planning of the Mayor's Office of Bogota, Sisbén and its main characteristics are defined as Identification System of Potential Beneficiaries of Social Programs, which allows classifying the population according to their living conditions and income. 
This classification is used to focus on social investment and ensure that it is allocated to those who need it most. The Sisbén is an information system that identifies and classifies the population according to its socioeconomic and social situation through a survey that ranks the population according to its social and economic status. 
The Sisbén information is used by social programs to identify their beneficiaries; being in the Sisbén does not guarantee automatic access to social programs or benefits. 
The entities in charge of the social programs are the ones that define the cut-off group and requirements to link their beneficiaries. From 1995 to date, the Colombian State has implemented four versions of the Sisbén. Each version has a methodology, i.e., a set of procedures to obtain the result that reflects the socioeconomic conditions of each person. The fourth version - Sisbén IV was implemented on March 5, 2021.
In Sisbén IV there are four groups that are denominated by letters. Each group is composed of subgroups identified by a letter and a number that allow for a more detailed classification of individuals.
There are four groups in Sisbén IV: group A, made up of the population with the lowest income-generating capacity or population in extreme poverty; group B, made up of poor households, but with greater income-generating capacity than those in group A; group C, made up of the population at risk of falling into poverty (vulnerable); and group D, made up of the non-poor population.


Classification

Group A	Made up of 5 subgroups (from A1 to A5)

Group B

Who participates in the Sisbén?

I. National Planning Department: Develops the Sisbén Methodology; designs the socioeconomic characterization form and the technological tools with which the surveys that feed the Sisbén database are applied; Applies quality controls, and validates the consistency of the information of the surveys and updates received from the Municipalities. Validates and publishes the certified information on the web page www.sisben.gov.co.
II. Territorial Entities - District Planning Secretariat: Implements administer and operate the Sisbén in Bogotá D.C. Applies the surveys following the guidelines established in the Methodology, sends the information to the National Planning Department for processing, validation of information consistency, certification, and publication of the classification result in www.sisben.gov.co, registers the information update procedures requested by citizens with which the Sisbén database is updated - sends the information of the update news to the National Planning Department for validation, certification, and publication within six working days after being received.



III. The entities that administer the social programs: Establish the cut-off group and requirements for admission to the programs. They select the potential beneficiaries of the social programs that meet the requirements.
IV. Citizens: Provide truthful information, under oath for the completion of the survey must keep updated the information of your household registered in the database.

Difficulties presented by Sisbén
The Sisbén has received strong criticism in its implementation, including its foundations and creation, beyond the already complexity corresponding to the selected tool that constitutes an on-site survey that any Colombian citizen can request, the socio-economic stratum of the dwelling is one of the variables of the Sisbén survey and this data is taken from what is registered in a domiciliary public service receipt that the household must present at the time of the survey (DPN, 2021),  The aim is that those who are registered in the lower strata (1,2,3), ideally constituted by the most vulnerable population, will have access to the different subsidies and social programs that allow them to mitigate their poverty indexes and access public policies such as education subsidies that allow them to generate social mobility; however, the strong shortcomings of stratification in Colombia as a targeting instrument have been widely presented in the previous sections of this theoretical framework. 
Through the article "Identification and affiliation of beneficiaries - Sisbén" developed by researchers Oscar Fresneda and Patricia Martínez for the Universidad Nacional, critical points are established in the selected methodology as well as difficulties in the implementation process of the surveys that generate the Sisbén stratification, the most relevant of which will be presented below.
The survey conducted in the municipalities also questioned municipal officials about problems that in their opinion have affected the quality of the Sisbén. Among those considered were circumstances of a different nature. The problem reported by most municipalities is the lack of technical standards in the application of Sisbén (50%), and once again, budgetary limitations (47.5%). They are followed by a lack of techniques in the application and updating of databases, as well as a lack of instruments to identify the poor, which are reported by 35.5%, 33.8%, and 20.1% of the municipalities respectively. These results indicate a perception of the absence of regulations for the operation of the Sisbén, which technically affects its administration. 22% of the municipalities have a perception of political management in the Sisbén that affects the implementation of the Sisbén and 12.3% are not affected by any of the mentioned problems. 
The lack of technical standards is a problem with more frequent expressions in the medium and small municipalities, which double the relative frequency of the large ones. And, in contrast, it is in the large municipalities where there are greater difficulties in updating the databases. Political management interference also has a higher proportion in large municipalities: 44.8%. In the medium-sized ones it reaches 40.7% and in the small ones 16.6%.
This situation corresponds to that reported on arbitrary entries and exits from Sisbén. In 39% of municipalities, it is reported that this situation has occurred in Sisbén levels 1 and 2. These are phenomena that affect the quality and bias of the beneficiary selection and affiliation processes, both due to the influence of client-list practices and other types of interests (economic, family, etc.). It is also in the larger municipalities where it is most prevalent (66%). It occurs in 41.4% of the medium-sized ones and 36.7% of the small ones (graph 34). In the survey of the departments, 64% of the sectional directorates surveyed reported that this phenomenon occurs in the municipalities under their jurisdiction.
From the responses obtained in the structured interview with the sample of municipal administrations, the perception of possible measures to improve the functioning of Sisbén is obtained (Graphs 35 to 38). Of the items considered, the one with the highest frequency was financial support. Of the items considered, the most frequent was financial support. 75.7% of the officials in the municipalities consider this to be necessary assistance. In the larger municipalities, the proportion reaches 93%. National and departmental technical assistance is considered necessary in 59.6% of the municipalities, and it is also in the large municipalities where the highest frequency is recorded: 68.2%. Technical training is perceived as necessary in 55% of the municipalities, and in this case, in the medium-sized ones, there is greater acceptance: 70.3%. Regulatory development is perceived as necessary in minority proportions: 20.1% of the municipalities; 42.7% in the large ones.
Some features of the situation of the municipalities with respect to the Sisbén administrator are as follows: Almost all municipalities have a Sisbén administrator. Most of those that reported filled this position between 1995 and 1996. Between 1998 and 2000, 22% of the municipalities made their first appointment to the position. 
Stability in the position, as an expression of continuity in Sisbén administration jobs, shows high mobility. Between 1998 and June 2000, 52.4% of the municipalities had more than one administrator, and 30.3% had more than two. In 72.9% of the municipalities, the Sisbén administrator is a municipal official. In 60% of the municipalities, the administrator has an exclusive dedication, without sharing other functions. In the medium-sized municipalities, 79% have this dedication and in the small municipalities 45%. 
The educational level of the administrator with the highest frequency is high school: 38.3%. 20.6% have completed university studies and 14.6% have completed studies at this level without completing them. 
Some 4.3% have a specialization and 21.7% have done technical studies. In the large municipalities, 32% have completed university studies, 23.3% have postgraduate studies or specialization and 40.6% have technical studies. Among the small municipalities, 46.5% have a high school education, 16.6% have incomplete university studies and the same proportion has technical studies.
Twenty-three percent of Sisbén administrators have not received specialized training for the functions of this position. The percentage is 19% in large companies and 23% in small ones. 40.1% of the administrators have received training from the department, 40.7% from the Social Mission, 30.2% from the previous administrator, and 13.6% from individuals.
An expression of the degree of institutionalization of Sisbén is the existence of a working group for its administration. In 65.3% of the municipalities, there is such a group. In 40% of the small municipalities, it has not been implemented, the same happens in 193% of the medium-sized ones and 4.2% of the large ones.
The Sisbén technical committees, contemplated in the technical guidelines given since the beginning of the program, are not constituted in 73.3% of the municipalities; in the large municipalities 31.8% are in this situation, in the medium-sized ones 70.3% and in the small ones 76.7%. Community organization committees on Sisbén have been created in 53.5% of the municipalities. And in this case, they operate more frequently in the small (56.8%), than in the medium (42.1%) and large (40.3%).
Seventy-eight percent of the municipalities report that the main reason for not enrolling those on the waiting list is a lack of budget. This situation affects 80% of the medium and small municipalities and 47% of the large ones. Non-authorization by the department affects 18.2% of the municipalities and has an incidence of 36% in the large municipalities.
Some indications regarding the perception of the adequacy of Sisbén to select the poor were captured in additional questions of the survey: 59% of the municipalities answered that Sisbén does not adequately identify the people who deserve to be in the subsidized regime, 68% in the large municipalities, 70% in the medium-sized municipalities and 57% in the small municipalities. Among the departmental health secretariats, 40% considered that Sisbén adequately selects the people who deserve to be in the Subsidized Health Regime.
Despite the four attempts to generate the Sisbén, Colombia continues to present great deficiencies in the establishment of effective mechanisms to guide public policies in favor of the most vulnerable communities. This is evidenced by the citizen monitor against corruption, which is an observatory of transparency for Colombia (national chapter of Transparency International), which continuously monitors the facts and risks of corruption, as well as public anti-corruption action in Colombia. Through its platform for information curation, research, and monitoring of corruption, it offers citizens open data, study methodologies, and descriptive and analytical reports on this phenomenon, and has found the following findings concerning the Sisbén:
“The System for the Identification of Potential Beneficiaries of Social Programs -SISBEN- is designed to identify and classify the population based on their socio-economic situation. In addition, it seeks to ensure that state attention reaches as a priority those people who are in extreme poverty, i.e., those who require urgent attention from the state to meet their most basic needs. The classification of the population in SISBEN is useful for decision-making and for targeting public policies and social programs of the attention of the local government (mayors' and governors' offices) and the national government.
The SISBEN must have accurate and updated information on the population that is most vulnerable due to its economic and financial situation. The inclusion in the SISBEN of people who do not require state assistance leads the state to make the wrong decisions when allocating resources, which directly affects the poorest.
The information consigned in Clear Accounts on Political Campaign Financiers in the elections of 2015 (territorial elections) and 2018 (legislative and presidential elections) and on the people who made contributions to finance the operation of political parties in the 2015-2019 period was reviewed. In this review, it was found that 34,075 campaign financiers in the period 2016 -2019 have contracts with the State, of this group.
There are 2,773 registered in SISBEN. In principle, this situation does not generate any problems because all citizens, regardless of their needs or economic capacity, have the right to finance political campaigns. However, it is impossible not to wonder about the financial capacity of these people if they are making contributions to political campaigns despite being SISBEN beneficiaries.
In this regard, among the contractor financiers registered in the SISBEN, 1,057 (approximately 38 percent) are classified with a score below 33 points. In other words, they are registered as extremely vulnerable. This condition qualifies them to access any state subsidy, whether for housing, education, conditional transfers, or health, among others. Even more serious is that of these 1057 people, 433 were in extreme poverty conditions in 2018 and 2019.
On the number of contributions to campaigns and political parties, the total of these resources amounts to 4,150 million 834,941 pesos. This means that on average each state contractor registered in the SISBEN contributed nine million 586,224 Colombian pesos. In addition to the generosity of these contributions, and despite their poverty status (according to the information reported in SISBEN), these individuals entered into contracts with the State for a total value of 118,693 million 713,265 pesos. That is, each person received on average a contract for a value of 274 million 119,430 pesos.

Emblematic cases
The following three cases show more clearly this relationship between funders - contractors and SISBEN beneficiaries.

•	Davys Vallejo Petro registers contracts with the State for 101 million Colombian pesos and made contributions worth 40 million to Karen Quintero, Kareina Arteaga, and Rubén Darío Guerra, all candidates for the Córdoba assembly. Davis appears in the SISBEN database with a score of 3,37. This information was validated on June 5, 2019).
•	José Gregorio Bayter Zumaqué appears registered in SISBEN with a score of 7.05, information validated on April 25, 2019. He has entered into contracts for 102 million 415,200 Colombian pesos and contributed 42 million 100,000 pesos to the campaign for the House of Representatives to Wadith Alberto Manzur and to the campaign for Mayor of Ayapel to Maricel Nader.
•	Finally, Rubén Darío Gutiérrez Hoyos entered into contracts for 149 million 379,561 pesos and contributed 20 million pesos to the campaign of Marcos Pineda Garcia, elected mayor of Monteria Gutiérrez. is registered in the SISBEN base with a score of 7.37 points, information validated on November 26, 2018.

It is not understood how these people who according to the SISBEN deserve priority attention for being in a condition of poverty, manage to make significant contributions to various political campaigns and has also been contractors with the State. In the first place, this situation could be an indication that the attention of those who really need the SISBEN is being diverted to favor other people. Secondly, there is a disconnection between the different instances that collect relevant information on contracting and campaign financing, which do not share information. Thirdly, there is a more cultural and personal problem in which people who evidently have favorable economic conditions seek to receive the benefits designed to support those who need it most, without caring that their criminal attitude is detrimental to those who are vulnerable and require urgent support from the State”.
Proposals on the necessary reforms to the targeting tools of socioeconomic stratification and Sisbén in Colombia are beyond the scope of this paper, however, their full analysis is of vital importance for the fulfillment of the objectives of this work. Through the implementation of the project, the relevance of these instruments in the life, well-being, and mobilization opportunities of Colombians will be observed through the implementation of public policies that truly impact communities in need.

METHODOLOGY
The methodology chosen for the implementation of this project is based on the document "Fundamental Methodology for Data Science" (IBM, 2015), whose basis is CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) which can be considered as the de facto methodology for projects dedicated to extracting value from data, which has been a source of inspiration for other standards such as SEMMA of SAS or ASUM-DM (Institute of Knowledge Engineering, 2020). Implementing important advances such as the emphasis on several of the new practices in data science, such as the use of large volumes of data, the incorporation of text analytics in predictive modeling, and the automation of some processes (IBM, 2015).

Stage 1: Understanding the business

Problem definition
The high level of inequality in Colombia is a fundamental constraint to economic growth and social progress. The country has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world; the second highest among 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and the highest among all OECD countries (World Bank, 2021). 
In this context, the Colombian state has generated targeting elements such as Socio-Economic Stratification and Sisbén in order to generate public policies conducive to mitigating poverty and generating social mobility for its most vulnerable population. Throughout this study, the aim is to analyze the relevance of various variables involved in public decision-making and the generation of programs whose main objective is to impact the neediest population.

Aims of the project
General Objective
To analyze the relevance and correlation of targeting tools such as socio-economic stratification and the Sisbén with the public policies generated in the social and economic spheres by the Colombian state. 
Specific objectives:
•	To create a base document that allows the application of emerging technologies in this case data science tools and ML that will serve as a guide in subsequent studies and projects involving public policies of the Colombian state.
•	Generate a manual that allows students, teachers, IT professionals, and any citizen with notions about programming to validate, contrast and carry out their own analysis of the public policies generated in Colombia.
•	Empower as many citizens as possible through knowledge, so that they can exercise their constitutional right to Citizen Oversight, which constitutes "the democratic mechanism of representation that allows citizens or different community organizations to exercise oversight over public management, with respect to the authorities, administrative, political, judicial, electoral, legislative and control bodies" (Law 80, 2003), with the aim of exercising proper oversight over projects aimed at overcoming inequality in Colombia, paying special attention to the choice of the target population.
•	Serve as a reference document in its technical component, for the implementation of training programs in the area of data science and ML within the programs "data science for all" and "All to code" initiatives of the GDG Sabana Cundinamarca by Google group of which I am the director.
•	Serve as a reference document for academic institutions and students in the IT area.


Stage 2: Analytical approach
Throughout this work, we will apply data science techniques corresponding to descriptive statistics as well as visualization techniques to understand the content of the data. 
As well as the introduction of predictive analysis through ML tools


Stage 3: Data requirements
The data collected corresponds to socio-economic information for Colombia updated to 2021 by the World Bank, DANE (Colombian National Department of Statistics), the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), the Kaggle portal, and the Colombian government's open data portal.
All datasets will be worked on in .csv format to which different tools of the emerging technologies listed above will be applied. This will be implemented in the Visual Studio Code editor.

This interactive graph shows the main drivers of changes in poverty in the region and by country, under different lines and for different indicators. A change in poverty can be driven by: (i) a change in average household income; and/or (ii) a change in the distribution of income. The factors can be negative or positive, depending on whether they decrease or increase poverty, respectively. The magnitude of the number will be useful in comparing which effect is more dominant than the other.

Stage 5: Understanding data
In this stage, tools are applied that allow in-depth knowledge of the data being analyzed. Likewise, descriptive statistics are implemented.
The data comprehension process for each of the data sets is presented below.
From the definition of DataFrame: from the Kaggle platform's Pandas course: A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column. The following analyses are implemented.

Loading modules and libraries:
The following is the import of the modules and libraries required for the implementation of this project.
 Fig16: Loading modules and computer libraries
 Fig17. Loading modules and plotting libraries
1. File_name: cityWorkCol.csv
Dataframe creation
We implement the creation of the df1 corresponding to the cityWorkCol.csv file.
 Fig18. cityWorkCol.csv.csv visualization in VSC

In data science, we usually analyze external data sets and many of these are in CSV format, so a CSV file is a table of comma-separated values. Hence the name: "Comma Separated Values" to read the data from a DataFrame we use the pd.read_csv() function.
The df.head(n) method is useful when you want to get a specific number of records, it returns the first n rows of the DataFrame. In this case the parameter given is 5, so an array with 5 records will be returned.

 
Fig19. Dataframe df1 creation with df.head() method

Sep is defined by the official Pandas documentation as a delimiter. In the process of reading the content of a file in csv format, the content of the dataframe is loaded and returned, when you look at the file for the first time you can notice that this is separated in this example by (;) and in fact if we run a df. shape the answer will be that this dataframe contains a single column that is to say it is arranged as a one-dimensional array and we cannot access its contents. 
Therefore, so that the file can be read by pandas and can be manipulated it is necessary to apply this parameter to describe that in this case the delimiter of our data is (;). The separator can be another character or even a custom separator.
Below is the Dataframe generated without the application of sep.

 
Fig20. Dataframe sf1 visualization without sep parameter

In the previous image, It returns an array with  the first 5 records generated by the parameter head(5). When observing the total dimensions of the array we have (115 rows x 1 column) it is a unidimensional array with 115 records. Under these conditions we cannot access the information contained in the file.
Next, you can see how the application of the parameter sep allows reading completely and correctly the file, in this way an array of sizes (115rows x 16columns). In this case the complete DataFrame is printed. You can see points arranged on the horizontal and vertical axes in the center of the image, these points represent data that are not shown for visualization reasons, but that must be taken into account for the corresponding analysis.
 
Fig20.Dataframe df1 visualization
It is also possible to access the last records of the array through the method df.tail(n) which returns the last n rows of the DataFrame in this case we access the last 6 records of the Dataframe.
 
Fig21. Dataframe df1 visualization with df.tail() method

Total number of rows and columns
To obtain the total dimensions of the array, the df.shape method is applied, which returns a tuple with the number of rows and columns of the DataFrame.
 
Fig22. Total number of rows and columns of dataframe df1

It is observed that the total dimension of the array is (115 rows x 16 columns). The first term corresponds to the number of rows or records and the second term corresponds to the number of columns of the DataFrame.

Specific selection of Dataframe values through set_option()
There are different ways to select specific values of a DataFrame, one of them being through the top-level options attribute. 
We can select the number of rows and columns we want to print from the df. Although this is a limited indexing option it can be very useful when you have very large datasets and want to access a limited number of rows and columns.
 
Fig23. Selection of specific columns values of df1 through set_option

It is important to understand that this is only a visualization process, the size of the array is not modified, when observing the output of the shape method we observe that the array continues with the dimensions of (115 rows x 16 columns).
Next we can choose both the number of records and columns that we want to obtain at the output

  
Fig24. Selection of specific columns and rows values of df1 through set_option

General data information
We can obtain general information about our dataset through the df.info() attribute. It returns:
•	The general information contained in each column includes its label.
•	It informs us of the size of the Dataframe in this case it gives us a total of 16 columns and 115 non-null records.
•	The number of non-null values in each column. In this example, we observe 115 non-null records.
•	The type of data discriminated by column
•	A small summary of grouping of data types in this case we observe that of a total of 16 columns only one is of type int64(1) and corresponds to 'Year', and the remaining 15 are of type object(15).
•	Memory Used: in this case, it is 14.5+ KB

 
Fig25. df.info() attribute of df1 DataFrame

To get a more detailed view of the column labels we apply the df.columns method.

In this form, we obtain all the columns of the DataFrame.

Checking the data type
It is very useful to know what types of data we are using in a DataFrame, beyond establishing an overview of our data, it is possible that based on these results we should implement changes in the data types because there are certain operations within the DataFrame that are allowed between certain types of data.

 Fig27. DataFrame df1 data types

We obtain 15 columns whose data type is object and an int64 data type corresponding to the Year column.

Request a list of unique values
The unique(). method returns a list of unique values corresponding to a specific column of the DataFrame. To apply this method, you must select the label corresponding to the column you want to analyze, in this case, it is the City label and applies the method. In this way, it performs a sweep of the entire column and extracts the non-repeated values found in it. The output returns the cities where the GEIH was implemented

 Fig28. unique() method

List of unique values and their frequency
When you want to see a list of unique values and the frequency with which they appear in the data set, use the value_counts() method, like the unique() method, select the label corresponding to the column you want to analyze, in this case the City label is selected again. The output shows the cities where the GEIH was implemented and in front of these the frequency with which they are repeated within the DataFrame.

 Fig29. value_counts() method

List of unique values and their frequency
When you want to see a list of unique values and how often they appear in your dataset, use the value_counts() method, like the unique() method, and you select the label corresponding to the column you want to analyze, in this case, the City label is selected again. The cities where the GEIH was implemented are obtained at the output and in front of these the frequency with which they are repeated within the DataFrame.
The value_counts() method also allows selection to be implemented via the loc and iloc access operators.
The following figure shows the selection process through the loc operator, this paradigm bases the attribute selection process on labels. In this paradigm, it is the value of the data index, that is, its label, that is the selection criteria, not its position.
loc[:, ["TO", "TD"]] this range determines two values; first the value of the records or rows which is the value that is represented before the comma(,).
In this example, we have [:] which would be the range corresponding to the records, when we leave the spaces blank by default this range selects from row 0 to the last row.
After the comma (,) there is the range corresponding to the columns and here we have ["TO", "TD"], that is, we select two columns with the labels "TO" and "TD". These tags must always be enclosed in quotation marks and within a square parenthesis.
The corresponding output is presented below. You can see the generation of the list of unique values corresponding to the given selection parameter. In this case, a scan is made through all the records belonging to the columns identified with the labels "TO", and "TD", all the unique values found in this process are returned, and in front of each of them the value of its frequency. Data size and data type are also presented. in this case you have; length: 115 and dtype: int64

 Fig30. value_counts() method with the loc operator

Next, the selection will be made through the selection operator iloc which selects data based on its numerical position.
In this case, the selected selection range is iloc[:, ]. As in the previous case of the loc operator, the range determines two values; first, the value of the records or rows is the value that is represented before the comma (,) and then the value corresponding to the selected range of the columns. For this example, we are selecting all records from all columns. When we do not place any references inside the selection fields established by default, all the values are selected.

 Fig31. value_counts() method with the iloc operator

It is relevant to analyze and compare the following outputs;
When observing the selection range of the first print, which corresponds to the previous implementation, it can be observed, as previously analyzed, that the given range establishes the selection of all the records and columns of the DataFrame, while the request within the second print does not present any selection operator. It requests that the value_counts() method be applied to the entire DataFrame, therefore, it can be inferred that the output corresponding to the two prints must be the same.
In conclusion, the two requests present the same selection range (the entire set of the DataFrame) written in two different ways.

Descriptive summary of the DataFrame df1
Descriptive summary of the DataFrame df1
A fundamental method in data analysis is df.describe(): which returns a DataFrame with a statistical summary of the array's columns. For numerical data (number) the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles are calculated. For non-numeric data (object) the number of values, the number of distinct values, the mode, and their frequency are calculated. It must be taken into account that if the type is not indicated, only numerical columns are considered.

 Fig35. Descriptive summary of the DataFrame df1

This method allows us to obtain valuable information about the DataFrame in which we are working, in this case, we can infer:
df.count(): Returns a series with the number of elements that are not null or NaN in each column of the DataFrame. In this case, 115 records are not null or NAN.
df.mean(): Returns a series with the means of the data of the numerical columns of the DataFrame, it is also known as average, it is the value obtained by dividing the sum of a conglomerate of numbers by the number of them. In the Year the mean column corresponds to 2021.565217.
df.std(): Returns a series with the standard deviations of the data in the numeric columns of the DataFrame. Std is a numerical index of the spread of a data set (or population). The greater the standard deviation, the greater the dispersion of the population. The standard deviation is an average of the individual deviations of each observation from the mean of a distribution. In this data set, the std = 0.579329, this value indicates that the data in the set has a high rate of dispersion.

df.min(): Returns the smallest value of the data in the Year column, in this case, the value is 2021.
df.max(): Returns the largest value of the data in the Year column, in this case, the value is 2023.

The quartiles are statistical measures of position that have the property of dividing the statistical series into four groups of equal numbers of terms. Quartiles allow you to quickly assess the spread and central tendency of a data set.
Below is a table with the basic description of the quartiles.

Quartile	Description
1st quartile (Q1)	25% of the data is less than or equal to this value: 2021
2nd quartile (Q2) 	The median. 50% of the data is less than or equal to this value: 2022
3rd quartile (Q3) 	75% of the data is less than or equal to this value: 2022
Table6: Quartile description

In the case of object type data, we can see that the data corresponding to the previously analyzed count(), unique() methods, the frequency of occurrence, and the top value corresponding to the first data obtained from each column is generated.

Once the process corresponding to Stage 5: Understanding data with Dataframe 1 has been implemented and analyzed, the process is replicated in a general way for the other data sets.

Stage 6: Data preparation
In this stage all activities are implemented to build the data set to be used in the subsequent stage of modeling. Data preparation activities include data cleansing (dealing with invalid or missing values, remove duplicates and format properly), combine data from multiple sources (files, tables and platforms) and transform data into more useful variables.
The data preparation process for each set is presented below.

1. File_name: cityWorkCol.csv
Treatment of missing data
Entries missing values are given the value NaN, short for "Not a Number". For technical reasons these NaN values are always of the float64 dtype.
Pandas provide some specific methods for handling missing data. To select NaN entries, you can use pd.isnull() or its plugin pd.notnull(). These methods allow you to highlight values that are (or are not) empty (NaN).
It can be seen in the following figure that 0 data of the NaN type are presented in df1, that is, there are no data of the NaN type.
 Fig90. pd.isnull() method

Next, it is confirmed that NaN type data is not presented by applying the notnull() method, this returns 115 notnull data, according to the previous stage the size of this Dataframe is (115, 16), therefore it is returning 115 records. In conclusion, the array does not present any data of type NaN.

  Fig91. pd.notnull() method

Data Type Conversion
As we observed in the preliminary analysis through the describe() method, we identified that only the Year column is of type int64 and the other columns are of type Object. To carry out the analysis corresponding to the DataFrame where it is required that these data be of a numeric type, such as the calculation of the mean, the variance, the quartiles, etc., a data type conversion must be implemented.
This conversion is done through the to_numeric() method, however, when applying this method, an error appears in the output, and two data cannot be transformed, as shown below:
 Fig92. Data transformation error

This type of error is very frequent, when data sets are obtained from external sources, most of the time these present inconsistencies, special characters within the data, and an endless number of situations that lead to the implementation of data-cleaning as a fundamental process in the data treatment.
To solve this error, the str.replace method is applied, which returns a copy of the string after replacing the occurrences of the old substring with new.

 Fig93. to_numeric() and str.replace() methods

As can be seen in the previous image, all the data in the TPG column were changed from object type to float type, and even the mean() of the data was calculated as a final exercise.
df1.columns.str.strip() is applied which removes white space in column data. We proceed to change the data types of the other columns.
.
 Fig94. df1.columns.str.strip() method

Next, the corresponding columns to which you want to implement any numerical analysis will be transformed

  Fig94. Data Type Conversion df1 Part1
   Fig95. Data Type Conversion df1 Part2

As can be seen in the previous figure, they have been transformed to float 32 type, in this way it is possible to manipulate the data of this DataFrame for its respective analysis.

2. File_name: GEIH.csv
Treatment of missing data
As can be seen in the following images, zero NaN data records are obtained.
 Fig96. pd.isnull() method

  Fig97. pd.notnull() method

Data Type Conversion
In the process of visualizing the data types, it was observed that they are all of the object types, therefore the respective conversion of the type is carried out for further analysis.
However, when trying to make the corresponding transformations, the following error appears:

 Fig98. Data transformation error

In this way, the error is overcome and the transformation of the data type is carried out successfully.

  Fig99Application dtype='unicode'
By applying dtype=unicode, the data transformation can be implemented via the astype (float) method. The following shows the data transformation of the other columns of the DataFrame.

      
   Fig100. Aplication astype (float) method in df2

Duplicate records
Next we check if there are duplicate records:
 Fig101. Duplicate record analysis
As can be seen in the image above, there are no duplicate records in the DataFrame df2

3. File_name: PovertyIncidenceRate.csv
Treatment of missing data
Parsing the amount of NaN data via the pd.isnull() method returns the following:

  Fig102. pd.isnull() method

There are 253 records with NaN value in the Tasa column. The first step to take is to analyze the data set paying special attention to the Tasa column.

  Fig103. PovertyIncidenceRate.csv visualization in VSC

The Tasa column corresponds to the value given as a percentage of the poverty rate both for the region in general and for the countries that comprise it.
Through the isnull() method we trace the records corresponding to the Rate column that present data of type NaN

  Fig104. pd.isnull() method applied to Tasa column

To identify the Dataframe records that contain NaN values and to be able to better analyze the steps to follow, the variable: nan_rows = df3[df3.isnull().any(1)] is created, which will contain all the records with NaN values in the array.
 
 Fig105. Dataframe records that contain NaN values

As can be seen in the previous image, 253 records are obtained that contain NAN values in the Tasa column of the DataFrame.
The first step to consider when obtaining this type of data is to try to communicate with the dataset collection source, in this case the World Bank. In this case, this step is not possible due to time constraints, we proceed to analyze it in depth of the previously obtained image where other relevant data for further analysis are observed; as the poverty line and its respective indicator.
Due to the previous finding it is decided:
In the first place, do not apply the replace() method, since by entering data randomly the statistical analyzes will be altered and since it is a poverty indicator, one must be much more prudent in its manipulation.
Secondly, do not apply the dropna() method that allows you to filter the data by returning a DataFrame without the records that contain NaN values. This decision is made based on the other data found in said records, described above, which may alter other important measurements to be analyzed.
Finally, the decision is made to apply the fillna() method, through which each NaN with an "Unknown" will be replaced:

 Fig106. fillna() method applied to Tasa column

The previous figure shows how the NAN data types were changed by the value "Unknown".

Data Type Conversion
In the process of visualizing the data types, it was observed that they are all of the object types, therefore the respective conversion of the type is carried out for further analysis.
It is important to transform the Tasa column to a numeric type in case you need to carry out mathematical or statistical operations with the percentage of the poverty index.


The process is shown below:
  Fig107. Aplication pd.to_numeric() method in df3

4.File_name:  PovertyIncomeContribution.csv
It can be seen in the following figure that 0 data of the NaN type are presented in df4, that is, there are no data of the NaN type.
  Fig110. pd.isnull() method

In the process of visualizing the data types, it was observed that they are all of the object types, therefore the respective conversion of the type is carried out for further analysis.
It is important to transform the Tasa column to a numeric type in case you need to carry out mathematical or statistical operations with the percentage of the poverty index.
The process is shown below:

5.File_name:  
PovertyMechanismsofchange.csv
It can be seen in the following figure that 0 data of the NaN type are presented in df5, that is, there are no data of the NaN type

  Fig112. pd.isnull() method

However, when analyzing the csv file, it is observed that the Poverty Line column contains 5 different data per record. 

 Fig113.Linea de Pobreza column

These data should be separated and placed in individual columns for further analysis. The new column labels are:
•	Classification: Contains the nominal classification of the socio-economic situation.
•	IngresoMin: Corresponds to the minimum value of the range established within the classification column
•	IngresoMax: Corresponds to the maximum value of the range established within the classification column
•	Año_Medicion: Corresponds to the year in which the different measurements were made, for the entire Dataframe it is 2017.
•	PurPoPa: Contains Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that try to equalize the purchasing power of different currencies, by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries.
This process is done through the concat() merge method. as shown below:

  Fig114. Aplication concat() method in df5
In the previous stage, it was determined that the dimensions of the DataFrame were: (2520 rows x 6 columns), as can be seen in the previous image, the new dimensions of the DataFrame are (2520 rows x 11 columns), this is due to the separation of data made previously.

Data Type Conversion
In the process of visualizing the data types, it was observed that they are all of the object types, therefore the respective conversion of the type is carried out for further analysis.
It is important to transform the Tasa, column to a numeric type in case you need to carry out mathematical or statistical operations with the percentage of the poverty index.
First, the $ sign must be removed from the records belonging to the columns IngresoMin and IngresoMax. This process is done by implementing the replace() method m through a  function.

It is important to transform the Share column to a numeric type in case you need to carry out mathematical or statistical operations with the percentage of the poverty index.
To carry out this process, the symbols ($), (%) must be eliminated from the data in the Share column, for this the replace() method is applied through  functions.
The process is shown below:

  Fig118. Elimination of the symbols ($), (%) from the column Share

It is important to transform the Centiles column to a numeric type in case you need to carry out mathematical or statistical operations with the percentage of the poverty index.
The process is shown below:

 Fig120. Data type conversion in the Centiles column.

Stage 7: Modeling
In this stage, the generation of descriptive models on the sets obtained in the previous stage is defined in the first instance.
Secondly, the generation of predictive models is defined through the application of ML techniques.


Stage 8: Evaluation
A. Descriptive model
In this stage, in the first instance, all the procedures will be applied, such as diagnostic measures, graphs, statistical analysis and other processes leading to the implementation of the descriptive model; that allow to address the problem object of this work in an adequate and complete way, thus achieving the fulfillment of the objectives set.
An equitable society is defined as one in which people have the same opportunities to follow the life they choose, regardless of the circumstances into which they were born, and are not subject to poverty (World Bank, 2005).
In this order of ideas, we proceed to analyze the socio-economic situation of Colombians according to the selected data sets.
We now analyze the socio-economic stratum variable, identified with the label (ESTRATO_VIVIENDA), as a fundamental element for targeting the population in a state of vulnerability in the five main cities of the country (Bogotá, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga).
First, a Series is created through the groupby() method that allows grouping all the values corresponding to the socio-economic stratum variable present in the dataset. The count() method is also applied, which generates the frequency of occurrence.
The following image shows the process mentioned previously
 Fig121. Frecuency of Socio-Economic Stratum

In order to achieve a better analysis of the process obtained above, the series is plotted using the seaborn tool as shown below:

  Fig122: Frequency of socio-economic stratum code

This tool allows the behavior of the count() method to be evidenced through a bar graph that relates the analyzed variable with the respective frequency.

  Fig123. Frequency of Socio-Economic Stratum

It is evident that strata 2, 3, and 1 contain the highest percentage of population concentration, corresponding to the population with the lowest purchasing power and the lowest income (Table 1). Therefore, it can be inferred that in Colombia's main cities, the majority of the population is in a critical condition in socio-economic terms.
In order to determine the respective percentages corresponding to each of the strata, the following procedure is implemented:
The group_estrato series created in the previous step is converted to the group_estrato1 DataFrame. 
It is relevant to note that stratum 9, the original value of the dataset, does not correspond to a socio-economic stratification level. By methodology of the GEIH 2021, this value corresponds to the citizens who answered Don't know/No answer in this question (Annex 2). For this reason, the respective label for stratum 9 is changed to Ns/Nr.

The sort_values() method is applied to sort the DataFrame with respect to the column previously created for strata.
The implementation of the process explained above is shown below:

   Fig124. al DataFrame group_estrato1

Finally, we proceed to implement a pie chart of the information generated, using the Plotly tool. In this way, the percentages corresponding to each of the socio-economic strata are obtained.
  Fig125. Percentages of Socio-Economic Strata.

With respect to the previous graph it can be concluded that 51.6% of the population is in the low classification, that is to say in poverty. 
Stratum 3 represents 32.2% of the population and is classified as lower-medium. It is mostly made up of people from lower strata who have achieved social mobility through their own efforts, generally through academic training at a technological level or in public institutions of higher education, as well as through the creation of small commercial establishments (trade between neighborhoods).
This population group is in great danger of being relegated to socio-economic strata 1 and 2 because they do not have savings or the necessary resources to assume an eventuality or fortuitous event that may occur.
An example of this situation is the pandemic; "the middle class contracted from 14.7 million people in 2019 to 12.5 million in 2020, which implies that 2.5 million Colombians dropped out of this category, due to a deterioration in their income... "The most important impact we are seeing is on the fraction of the population that is middle class. While the country observed 30.1% of its population in the middle class by the 2019 income distribution, we are seeing a reduction in this case of 4.6 percentage points in the weight of this group in the country" DANE (2020).
This implies that, during 2020, the population belonging to the middle class of the country, i.e. stratum 3, was the hardest hit, generating 3.5 million new poor people in just one year, going from 17.4 million to 21.0 million people, generating a setback in social mobility.
The fact that the vulnerable population is falling back into poverty has devastating consequences for the national economy. For the IDB, "the middle class can move the national economy and generate prosperity for more people because of its impact on the generation of capital, its purchasing power, its demand for quality goods and its multiplier effect on spending (chaining)".
Continuing with the analysis, stratum 4 corresponds to 10.2% of the Colombian population and is classified as Medium concerning its purchasing power.
Stratum 5 corresponds to 3.59% of the population and is classified as medium-high concerning its purchasing power.
Only 2.25% of the entire Colombian population is classified as stratum 6 which corresponds to a high level of purchasing power.
By combining the population corresponding to strata 5 and 6, we obtain that only 5.84% of the citizens of the 5 largest cities in Colombia have high purchasing power.
The above analysis corroborates the serious situation of inequality in Colombia. "Income inequality in Colombia is very high. In 2019, it was the highest among all OECD countries, and most Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Moreover, inequality in Colombia has been on the rise since 2018 and was further exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. The Gini coefficient of household income (a standard measure of inequality) reached 0.53 in 2019, after taxes and transfers" (World Bank, 2021).
Similarly, the UNDP warned in 2020 that the "economic recovery, like the crisis, will not be the same for everyone; the most vulnerable people will have more difficulties".
A survey by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) revealed that while 80 % of lower-income families suffered job losses, this situation was experienced by only 15 to 20 % of higher-income families. One of the most powerful reasons for this difference is that informality and underemployment are largely found in strata 1, 2, and 3, while the other strata have formal jobs, which allowed them to telecommute during the period of confinement.
It is important to contrast at this point the figures given by DANE (2020) with those obtained in this analysis. DANE reports 30.1% of the population in the middle class, i.e. stratum 3, and the graph under analysis reports 32.2% of the Colombian population in this stratum. 
This is an indicator that the sample taken from the GEIH 2021 corresponding to the main cities up to this point represents the study population.
We proceed to analyze the variable NAME_DEPTO, which contains the names of the five main cities in the country where the GEIH has been carried out, corresponding to Bogotá, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga.
Applying the procedure, first of all, a Series is created through the groupby() method that allows grouping all the values corresponding to the socio-economic stratum variable present in the dataset. 
Likewise, the count() method is applied, which generates the frequency of occurrence.
The following graph shows the aforementioned process:
  Fig125: Cities frequency code
In order to achieve a better analysis of the process obtained above, the Series is plotted using the Seaborn tool, as shown below:

 Fig127. Cities frecuency  graph code

The following graph presents the frequency of the cities:
 Fig126. Cities frecuency

It can be observed that the cities with the highest number of respondents are Medellin, Bogotá, and Barranquilla. It can also be inferred that the number of respondents in the city of Medellin is double the number of respondents in the city of Cali.
According to data from DANE (2020) one year before this survey was implemented, the cities had the following number of inhabitants:


City	Population
Medellín	2569007
Cali	2496346
Bogotá	8380801
Barranquilla	1239804
Bucaramanga	528 572
Table7. The population of the five main cities

Next, the series generated in the previous step is converted to the: DataFramegroup_by_Department_Name1.
Subsequently, the Population column is created, which contains the data corresponding to the population of each of the cities analyzed.
The cities column is also created, which contains the data corresponding to the cities analyzed.
Finally, the sort_values() method whose parameter is Population is applied. This creates the Dataframe by_population, which contains all the implementations described above.

  Fig127a DataFrame by_population code Part1

   Fig127b DataFrame by_population code Part2

Finally, we proceed to implement a pie chart of the information generated, using the Plotly tool. In this way, the percentages corresponding to each of the cities in which the survey was implemented are obtained.
