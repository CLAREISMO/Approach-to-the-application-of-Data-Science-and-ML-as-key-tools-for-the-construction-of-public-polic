Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to the entire KaggleX BIPOC project team for this life-transforming and community-transforming initiative. All their dedication, effort, and support in providing us with incredible tools for training and growth have borne fruit through the creation of a global community united by the love of data science and ML, constantly supporting each other and focused on generating high-impact projects and developments.

Secondly, I would like to thank my mentor Sagar Ganapaneni, a source of inspiration in my professional development, whose guidance and ongoing support enabled me to exceed the goals set at the beginning of this program.  Special thanks also to my mentor Mani Sarkar who was always there to support us all, for taking the time and effort to take us as his own mentees. Thanks to the team of mentors who were always willing to guide us and share their knowledge regardless of schedules, their commitment to our development was fundamental in the process. 

I would like to extend my thanks and appreciation to all my colleagues, for their constant support, their continuous willingness to create community, and of course for all their efforts to successfully complete this program.

Approach to the application of Data Science and ML as key tools for the construction of public policies in Colombia. This is the final project of the KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Program; its objectives are based on increasing representation, creating career opportunities, and developing individual growth of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Colour) people in the data science industry. 

Finally, it is my desire that as many people as possible from the Latino community to which I belong have the opportunity to transform their reality through access to this program and its benefits.
